The perfect old-fashioned comforting dessert. Boil cold water, long grain rice and salt to achieve a tender-soft rice, then turn off the heat and add sugar and milk and whisk to deglaze and blend. Cook until the pudding is as thick as you like. Add a pinch of cinnamon, vanilla and egg yolk and whisk until combined. Then add butter and dry fruit, such as raisins or cherries. While warm, transfer to dessert dishes, chill completely and serve dusted with cinnamon, topped with fresh fruit, or beautifully bruleed with a thin crunchy sugar topping!
